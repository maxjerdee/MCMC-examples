# MCMC examples

Three simple examples of Bayesian inference to understand systems, using STAN (particularly pystan). Example code is in the base directory, there is a `data` folder with example datasets.

## Example 1: Coin flips
A biased coin flip, inferring the probability of heads. Run `coin_flips.py`

## Example 2: Linear regression
A simple linear regression model, inferring the relationship between a predictor and an outcome. Run `linear_regression.py`

## Example 3: Network hierarchy
A Bayesian generalization of the Bradley-Terry model of hierarchies in directed interactions. (Depth-only model from https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adn2654) Run `network_hierarchy.py`
